Performance Module

Description: This module is designed to manage the complete employee appraisal (evaluation) cycle in
a structured, transparent, and automated way. Its main aim is to help HR teams, Department managers,
and employees participate in fair and consistent performance evaluations that follow standardized rules
and processes.

Performance Flow

The Performance Appraisal Management Module manages the complete lifecycle of employee
evaluations, ensuring a structured, fair, and transparent appraisal process. It integrates multiple stages
from template creation to final archivingâwhile supporting collaboration between HR, managers, and
employees.

Phase 1: Planning and Setup The process begins when the HR Manager defines standardized
appraisal templates. These templates establish the rating scales, evaluation criteria, and appraisal types
(such as annual or probationary), which are then assigned to specific departments or organizational
units. After the templates are finalized, the HR Manager or HR Employee sets up the appraisal
cycle, defining its duration, start and end dates, and assigning the appropriate templates to relevant
managers. The organizational structure data determines reviewer hierarchies and reporting lines for each
employee.

Phase 2: Evaluation and Review During the active appraisal cycle, each Department Manager
evaluates assigned employees using the approved templates. The manager provides performance ratings,
qualitative comments, and development recommendations. Attendance and punctuality information from
the Time Management module may also inform the assessment. Throughout this phase, the HR Manager
monitors progress through a centralized dashboard, ensuring timely completion of appraisals. Once all
evaluations are finalized, HR publishes the official results to employees.

Phase 3: Feedback and Acknowledgment Following publication, the Employee reviews their appraisal results, including performance ratings, comments, and development notes. The system automatically saves the complete appraisal record within the employee profile, maintaining a historical record of
performance outcomes for future reference and analytics.

Phase 4: Dispute and Resolution After receiving results, employees are granted a defined period to
raise objections or appeal their evaluations. If a dispute is submitted, it is routed to the HR Manager
for review. The HR Manager may either uphold the original assessment or adjust the final rating based
on the justification provided. Once resolved, the decision is logged and the finalized rating updated in
the system.


Phase 5: Closure and Archiving When all evaluations and disputes are complete, the system automatically archives the finalized appraisal data. Historical appraisal records become accessible for reference, reporting, and performance trend analysis. This ensures long-term data integrity and supports
evidence-based HR decision-making across appraisal cycles.
