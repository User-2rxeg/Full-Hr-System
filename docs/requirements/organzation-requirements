Organizational Structure:

Organization Structure Module

Description: This module defines how the company is organized. It allows the System Administrator to
create departments and positions, update them when changes happen, and deactivate positions that are
no longer needed while keeping their history. Managers can request changes to reporting lines or positions,
and these requests go through an approval process to keep the structure accurate and logical. Role-based
views allow employees and managers to see the org chart appropriately. Changes automatically update
dependent modules (e.g., Payroll, Recruitment, Employee Profiles) to keep data consistent.


Organization Structure Flow

The Organizational Structure Management (OSM) Module governs how departments, positions,
and hierarchical structures are created, updated, and maintained across the HR system. This ensures that
the organizational framework remains accurate and aligned with operational and administrative needs,
serving as a foundation for recruitment, payroll, and performance processes.

Phase 1: Structure Definition The process begins when the System Administrator defines and
creates new organizational entities such as departments or positions. These additions accommodate new
roles within the company hierarchy. Each position is linked to a department and assigned its relevant
attributes including identification codes, reporting lines, and pay grades. Once created, the position
becomes available for recruitment and integration into downstream HR functions.

Phase 2: Structural Maintenance When modifications are needed, the System Administrator
performs direct updates or maintenance of existing departments and positions. This may include renaming, reassigning, or updating attributes such as reporting structures or pay grades. Structural changes
are applied immediately across the system to maintain data consistency between the organizational structure and dependent subsystems.

Phase 3: Deactivation and Synchronization When a position or department becomes obsolete,
the System Administrator deactivates it from the active structure. Positions with historical employee
records are not deleted but are delimited—meaning they are closed as of a certain date—to preserve
organizational history. These updates ensure the system retains full historical accuracy while keeping the
active organizational chart current and synchronized across all modules.

BR 41 (Access must be role-based, where Direct Managers see their team only and Employees see their own structure).


Receive a Request for a new Position in the Department

"REQ-OSM-03: As a Manager, I want to submit requests for changes to the team assignments, so that team structures reflect actual work relationships

REQ-OSM-04: As a System Admin, I want to review and approve manager requests for changes, so that modifications to the hierarchy are controlled and consistent"

"Employee Profile (EP) data, as changes to reporting line or position updates sometimes originate from profile updates or require fetching current employee details
Organizational Structure (OS) current position details and reporting lines, which the manager intends to modify"

"Organizational Structure (OS): The request is saved in the pending approval queue, triggering.
Notifications (N): An alert is sent to the System Admin (or relevant approver) that a ""Change request submitted"


"BR 36: All changes must be made via workflow approval
REQ-OSM-09: The process enforces validation rules to prevent circular reporting lines, duplicate positions, or mismatched department assignments"
