# Project TODOs

## Data Consistency Issues
- [ ] **Team Scoping Mismatch**: Team profiles fetch 8 people while Team Structure/Org Chart fetch 4 for the same manager. (Reported 2026-01-30)
- [ ] **Employee Count Mismatch**: HR Admin Dashboard shows 22 total employees but status-specific cards sum to 21 (18 Active, 2 Terminated, 1 Probation). Investigate if one employee has a missing or different status (e.g. Inactive, Suspended).

- [x] **Data Science & Visualization (US-E6-03)**:
    - [x] Added **Smart Insights Panel** with tenure and performance pulse.
    - [x] Added **Behavioral Retention Signals** (Career Itch zone detection).
    - [x] Added **Talent Matrix (9-Box Grid)** for visual talent mapping.
    - [x] Integrated view switching (List vs Matrix).

## Feature Requirements
- [x] **US-E6-03**: As an HR Admin, I want to be able to search for employees data.
    - [x] Verify search by name, ID, Email, National ID.
    - [x] verify combined searching and filtering.
